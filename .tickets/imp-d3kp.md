# Epic 7: Mobile Responsiveness & Polish

Make the app mobile-friendly (primarily desktop but usable on mobile). Final polish pass.

Key tasks:
- Responsive breakpoints: tables collapse to card layout on mobile
- Touch-friendly controls for inline editing
- Collapsible sections on mobile
- Navigation: sticky header with quick links to sections
- Performance: lazy-load charts, virtualize large tables if needed
- PWA manifest for add-to-home-screen (optional)
- Loading states and error handling polish
- Empty states (no API key, no data)
- Keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+S to save, Escape to cancel edit)
- Accessibility: ARIA labels, focus management, color contrast
- Final testing across browsers
